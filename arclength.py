script to calculate arc length
uses a summation instead of finding the derivative of f(x) and using the traditional formula


uses a summation approximation where the length of the curve is estimated by the 
length of the hypotenuses of right triangles, where one leg (parallel to x axis) is delta_x 
and one leg (parallel to y axis) is (f(x sub i) - f(x sub i - 1))

currently accurate to 7 significant figures -- note: prints out number rounded to 7 decimal places
